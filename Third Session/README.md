# 📚 Introduction to Python Packages

Welcome to the **Introduction to Python Packages** repository! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that provides an introductory exploration of several essential Python packages commonly used for tasks like file handling, numerical computations, data manipulation, and visualization.

## 🌟 Course Objectives

By the end of this notebook, you will be able to:
- Understand the functionality provided by essential Python packages.
- Perform file and directory manipulations using the `os` and `glob` modules.
- Utilize **NumPy** for numerical computations and array manipulations.
- Apply **SciPy** for scientific computing tasks such as optimization and integration.
- Create visualizations using **Matplotlib**.
- Manipulate data efficiently with **Pandas**.
