# 📚 Introduction to Geospatial Python Packages

Welcome to the **Introduction to Geospatial Python Packages** repository! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that provides an introductory exploration of essential Python packages commonly used for geospatial data analysis, visualization, and manipulation.

## 🌟 Course Objectives

By the end of this notebook, you will be able to:
- Understand the functionality provided by key geospatial Python packages.
- Perform geospatial data manipulations using **GeoPandas**.
- Read and write raster data with **Rasterio**.
- Handle multi-dimensional datasets using **Xarray**.
- Visualize geospatial data effectively with **Matplotlib**.

## 📅 Table of Contents

- [GeoPandas](#geopandas)
