# 🌊 The Water Cycle: Nature's Continuous Process

Welcome to the **Water Cycle** repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the water cycle, its stages, importance, and its implications for agriculture, especially in the context of drought.

## 🌟 Objectives

By the end of this course, you will:
- Grasp the fundamentals of the water cycle and its key stages.
- Understand the impact of human activities on the water cycle.
- Learn about drought and its effects on agriculture.
- Calculate key drought and aridity indices using Python.

## 📚 Features

- **Key Stages of the Water Cycle:** Explore evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection processes.
- **Importance of the Water Cycle:** Learn how the cycle sustains ecosystems, regulates climate, and distributes nutrients.
- **Drought Analysis:** Understand different types of drought and their agricultural impacts.
- **Python Integration:** Utilize libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **GeoPandas** for data analysis and visualization.
